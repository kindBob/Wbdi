              Growing up in Atlanta, Carti was influenced by the city's rich hip-hop culture. His
              early exposure to trap music and the city's vibrant music scene helped shape his
              unique artistic direction.

              the breakout hit "Magnolia." His innovative approach to music production and vocal
              delivery quickly set him apart from his contemporaries.
